# Liquidation

Trustee can decide to liquidate an Asset Pool e.g. when the Assets are not performing therefore need to be liquidated to return funds to Funders. When this process is triggered, the Asset Pool: Is unable to accept new subscriptions from Liquidity Pool or Backers Is unable to purchase new assets or to make new loans Uses the Pool Reserve to redeem Liquidity Pool Returns any remaining amount to Backers As there are no on-chain secondary markets for loans, the liquidation process may take place off-chain with the Trustee depositing the proceeds to Pool Reserve to repay Funders.
