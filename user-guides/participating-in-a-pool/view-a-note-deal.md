# View a note deal

Once logged in investors land on the Market/Note page where they can see different investment (in notes) opportunities on offer. A particular implementation of the solution is to have a single pool where investors buy notes from. This pool will then invest in/lend to other pools. Investor can look at the the note in terms of duration, yield, how much has been raise (ie remaining investment capacity), pool value and also who are the originator/issuer of the pool Investors can click in to view more detailed info: executive summary, asset summary (if the pool already has assets), individual asset detail and their performance to date. All these information helps investor to evaluate the opportunity before investing and on-going monitoring of its performance
