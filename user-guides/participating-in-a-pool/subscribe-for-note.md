# Subscribe for note via Dutch auction

The platform supports note token sale via Dutch auction, “simple subscription” or “direct allocation” Dutch auction is where the price keeps decreasing (or yield increasing like in this case) until a level of equilibrium is reached. Dutch auction sale is popular in the fixed income market as it is an effective way for price discovery. An investor clicks on Bid and then can see the details of note token on sale. The investor then puts in the amount they would like to invest then confirms going ahead. The investor needs to link the platform to a Metamask wallet (with DAI or USDC) The investor then sign a subscription agreement directly on the platform then authorise the release of stable coins for the investment Once the transaction is processed, investor can track the investment within “my investment” page
