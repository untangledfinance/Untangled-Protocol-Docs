# KYC

### Onboarding and KYC

Investments in Untangled Pool's are usually private placements from a regulatory perspective. This comes with certain regulatory requirements. For example, behind Untangled pools are a SPV incorporated in Delaware. Private placements from the SPV are conducted under Reg D or Reg S of the [US Securities Act of 1933](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf) which means US investors must be accredited and all investors must clear standard KYC ("Know Your Customer") checks. All investors must also sign a subscription agreement ("SubDoc") with the pools "Issuer", so the legal entity/SPV behind the pool.

This legal set-up leads to certain restrictions. For example, there usually is a minimum investment amount per pool, US investors have to be Accredited Investors and, unfortunately, investors from certain countries may be excluded due to sanctions or missing tax treaties.

**Onboarding quick guide**

To adhere to the regulatory requirements, Untangled has integrated Persona for an automated KYC/AML process.

After you have connected your wallet you want to use for the investment into a Untangled pool, there are three main steps to complete the onboarding (see further below for a more detailed step-by-step guide):

1\) Link your permissioned wallet

First you need to link a newly created or existing wallet account to your profile on the platform. This is a one-time step.

2\) Complete KYC through Persona

In the next step you will be transitioned to Personal screens (whilst still in Untangled Finance app) for KYC so Persona can verify your identity and investor status if you are an US resident. To complete KYC, Persona will usually ask you to provide:

* A government issued photo ID or passport
* \[Optional] A selfie with this government issued photo ID
* Proof of address, e.g. utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, not older than 3 months

Persona’s automated KYC process is usually conducted within the same online session. If a manual review is required it may take longer.

Note, that this is a only one time step to become an eligible investor for Untangled. Thus, you can reuse your KYCed profile for all Untangled pools.

3\) Sign Subscription Agreement

The final step is to digitally sign the subscription agreement with the pool's Issuer through Untangled. Please read the subscription agreement and attached executive summary carefully and sign it, fill in your data. Depending on your country of tax residency you may also be required to fill out additional tax forms. Your completed and signed document will be automatically shared with the pool’s issuer. After the Issuer has counter-signed and your KYC has cleared your wallet address will be whitelisted for investment and you are ready to go.

Note that this only has to be done once for every pool. This means that once you have signed the subdoc with the issuer you can freely invest and redeem in this pool.

They are entitled to this privileged access by satisfying certain requirements regarding their income, net worth, asset size, governance status or professional experience. In the U.S, the definition of an accredited investor is put forth by [SEC in Rule 501 of Regulation D](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=\&SID=8edfd12967d69c024485029d968ee737\&r=SECTION\&n=17y3.0.1.1.12.0.46.176).

The regulations for accredited investors vary from between jurisdictions but usually require that a person:

* must have a certain annual income \[currently $200,000 ($300,000 for joint income) in the US] or\

* must have a certain net worth \[currently $1 million in the US] or\

* be a general partner, executive officer, or director for the company that is issuing the unregistered securities or\

* be a registered brokers and investment advisor\
