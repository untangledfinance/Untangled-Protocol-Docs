# Introduction

**Whale is a decentralised credit protocol that bridges crypto liquidity pools with green and impact financing assets. We expand the collateral universe towards real world assets whilst helping solve Earth’s biggest challenge - climate change impact - through crypto’s power of coordination and capital allocation.**

Whale Protocol is a decentralized protocol that allows for crypto borrowing against real world ‘green’ collaterals.\
\
\*The protocol name takes inspiration from how whales help cool the earth. During a whale pump (hence the token name Pump) it provides nutrients for phytoplankton which in turns sequesters atmospheric CO2. It is estimated that this process provides up to 50% of earth's O2, i.e. every other breath that each of us humans take.
