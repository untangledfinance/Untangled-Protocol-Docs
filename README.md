# Introduction

{% hint style="success" %}
**Whale is a decentralised credit protocol that bridges crypto liquidity pools with green and impact financing assets. We expand the collateral universe towards real world assets whilst helping solve Earth’s biggest challenge - climate change impact - through crypto’s power of coordination and capital allocation.**

Whale Protocol is a decentralized protocol that allows for crypto borrowing against real world ‘green’ collaterals. \
\
\*The protocol name takes inspiration from how whales help cool the earth. During a whale pump (hence the token name Pump) it provides nutrients for phytoplankton which in turns sequesters atmospheric CO2. It is estimated that this process provides up to 50% of earth's O2, i.e. every other breath that each of us humans take.Loom is a video messaging tool that helps you get your message across through instantly shareable videos.\

**Good to know:** Splitting your product into fundamental concepts, objects, or areas can be a great way to let readers deep dive into the concepts that matter most to them. Combine guides with this approach to 'fundamentals' and you're well on your way to great documentation!
