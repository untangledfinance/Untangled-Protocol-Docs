# Liquidation

Trustee can decide to liquidate the Pool e.g. when the Assets are not performing therefore needs to be liquidated to return capital to noteholders. When this process is triggered, the Pool

* Is unable to accept new subscriptions&#x20;
* Is unable to purchase new assets or make new loans&#x20;
* Uses the Pool Reserve to redeem SOT Holders&#x20;
* Returns any remaining amount to JOT Holders

As there are no on-chain secondary markets for loans, the liquidation process may take place off-chain with the Trustee depositing the proceeds to Pool Reserve to repay tokenholders.
