# Redemption

At any point in time, Liquidity Providers can redeem. So long as there are funds in the Pool Reserve, the contract will redeem tokenholders according to the prevailing token prices. JOT tokenholders can also redeem so long as after such redemption the Minimum First Loss can still be maintained.
