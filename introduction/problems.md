# Crypto is not Green

Some of the major criticisms of crypto from an environmental perspective is that it consumes large amounts of electricity. Bitcoin and Ethereum (currently) are Proof-of-Work blockchains.

### Current DeFi borrowing requires crypto collaterals

Crypto lending is the largest and fastest growing segment of decentralised finance (DeFi). It is said to be truly peer-to-peer without involvement of middlemen, thus preserving value for both borrowers and lenders. However current crypto lending is mostly collateralised by native crypto assets. This excludes a vast majority of borrowers and projects from accessing crypto credit, particularly those financing real world assets such as renewable energy projects and trade finance.

### Supply side - Lack of RWA collaterals especially green

Some crypto credit projects have started to finance real world assets. However, there are none dedicated to financing green assets. Other crypto projects focus on tokenizing carbon credits by buying existing credits and holding in the hope for price appreciation. Whilst this is an important first step to make carbon credits more accessible to investors, it does not create new credits through financing new green projects.

### Demand side - unmet demand for green collateral

An increasing number of protocols - layer 1 blockchains, stablecoins and other lending protocols would like to allocate capital toward green and impact collateral assets. Currently there are no transparent and easy ways of doing so at scale. This is because of limitations on both supply side (availability of green and impact crypto collaterals) and demand side (how can decentralised crypto project onboard real world assets).

### Greenwashing

Where real world assets are financed there often lack an on-chain credit disbursement and tracking. These are essential for transparency and investor protection but crucial when the asset involved is purported to be ‘green’. In other words, how to avoid greenwashing?

### Difficult to scale

Financing real world assets where part of the process involves off-chain interactions makes it more difficult to scale. Trusted third parties such as asset originators, issuers are necessarily involved in the network but require ‘skin in the game’ before liquidity providers are comfortable to risk their capital. On the other hand, a large liquidity pool would attract asset originators who can originate high quality assets. This is the classic ‘chicken and egg’ problem in any 2-sided marketplace.

### Climate change is a coordination problem and a capital allocation problem

The global nature of climate change impact demands global coordination and an efficient capital allocation channel. Averting climate change impact also requires a wide participation of actors: asset backers, liquidity providers, certifiers, auditors who are incentivized around a common, unifying goal.
