# How it works

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/antcpETfrZYkTQwT3v2gSpFdZr8zGcml8BYwf-\_yXmTf0QX-pHwAob\_eWBw6cY6Jc0O\_7mlF0TmcL-NaE4jSalehjdDl5Y3RiuYy0KhzWZADS6RUBuFC3fnNcC3oafdNKmPhF0QoygjvHAuIYg)

With Untangled, each funding pool is standardised in the way that the assets such as invoices, loans, inventories are tokenized into NFTs from which fractional interests are sold to investors. Combining that with standard legal structures, automation and advanced analytics we have the ability to massively reduce transaction costs associated with asset financing and the number of middlemen involved whilst ensuring full transparency.

We manage the end to end legal and tokenization process to bridge assets between the "real world" and DeFi. We ensure full composability with the decentralized finance ecosystem on Ethereum and other blockchain
