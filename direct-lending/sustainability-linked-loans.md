# Sustainability Linked Loans

Under the [Direct Origination Model](direct-origination-model.md), it is possible to subject loan disbursement to the achievement of certain impact targets (or impact points). This requires the Lender, in this case the Pool, to nominate a trusted third party such as a certification agency to attest impact points.&#x20;

Once the impact points are certified, they are tokenized and used (as a type of collateral) for sustainability-linked loan disbursement. Usually interest rates charged on these loans are lower compared to similar loans without the impact points. This incentivizes borrowers to achieve sustainability objectives in order to save interest costs. This type of loan terms can be defined in `Term Contract`.
