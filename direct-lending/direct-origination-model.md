# Direct Origination Model

Any borrower can also approach the Pool directly with a Debt Order (a loan request). The Protocol

* Administers the entire life-cycle of a loan through smart contracts&#x20;
* Collateral is held in escrow in smart contracts and released to creditors (in this case it is the Pool) upon a borrower's default&#x20;
* Poolâ€™s stake in a loan is "tokenized" -- it can be traded, repackaged, and programmed like any other token&#x20;
* Virtually any type of debt agreement can be defined with a Terms Contract e.g., supply chain invoice financing or a construction loan for a renewable energy project.
