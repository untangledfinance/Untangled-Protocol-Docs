# Protocol Overview

Whale Protocol represents a modular solution for a complete value chain in bridging crypto liquidity pools to real world assets. The modules are:

1. Liquidity Pool: A system of smart contracts responsible for managing full cycle of issuing note tokens, calculating token price based on net asset value to redeeming token for investors
2. Asset Origination: smart contracts that manage the full cycle of tokenising debts (loan asset token), calculating interests accrued to managing the repayment through either Agent Origination Model (Originator sells assets to Pool) or Direct Origination Model (Pool lends directly to end Borrower)
3. PUMP governance token that aligns interests among key participants, bootstraps the network and acts as a risk backstop. In the following sections we will discuss each of these modules in turn.
