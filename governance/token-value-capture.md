# Token Value Capture

### Protocol revenue&#x20;

PUMP is the Whale Protocol token. Fees earned by the Protocol will go to the Treasury. The Treasury may pay for various Protocol’s costs such as the development and maintenance of the network. Part of the surplus will be used to buy and burn PUMP, reducing the amount in circulation. This supply contraction helps increase PUMP price, other things being equal.&#x20;

There are 2 main types of fees:&#x20;

* 30% of spread or 1% of Pool Value (Pool Asset + Pool Reserve) whichever is higher.&#x20;
* 0.5% of redemption amount of SOT

### Backstop risks&#x20;

Essentially the Whale is a leverage protocol. It allows Originators and Borrowers to leverage on the Asset they own. With leverage comes risk. Therefore PUMP also acts as a backstopper for risk. At the first layer, any loss will be covered by the surplus in the Treasury. When the surplus is depleted, the Protocol will mint new PUMP to cover the loss. This mechanism increases the supply of PUMP therefore dilutes the PUMP holders. This feature has been widely used in practice by risk lending protocols such as Aave and Maker. The necessity of a Governance Token as a way to backstop risk is discussed extensively in this article: https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/16/daos-manage-risk/ This “Skin in the game” gives comfort to Senior noteholders including lending protocols, therefore essential to Protocol’s success.

### Bootstrapping&#x20;

Early Liquidity and Participation Early Liquidity Providers could receive reward in PUMP by staking SOT and JOT. This will help increase the returns on their investment and long term commitment to the Protocol. This method of distributing PUMP will also ensure a wide distribution.
