* 25% - Team&#x20;
* 25% - Investors&#x20;
* 25% - Treasury

### Liquidity for PUMP&#x20;

We will seek to bootstrap PUMP liquidity by collaborating with Liquidity-as-a-Service protocols. Generally speaking this involves providing PUMP in liquidity pairs in decentralized exchanges. More details to follow.&#x20;
